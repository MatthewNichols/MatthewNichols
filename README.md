## Hello, I am Matthew

### Stuff about me

- I am a (software/science/sci-fi/space/history) geek. 

- I am a Coloradan living in Iberia, mostly Gibraltar and Valencia.

- Veteran software developer, mostly on the web. I love Javascript/Typescript, C# and I think Vue, VSCode and WSL are stunningly cool. I am intrigued by Python, WASM and Rust but am still pretty new at them.

- I am an autodidact and usually learning lots of things; curiousity is probably my most defing trait. At the moment they include:
    - 3D Modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
    - Drawing with [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)
    - Photograpy
    - Cooking

- I think the sorting hat would put me in Ravenclaw, but I think I have a slight Slytherin tendencies.
