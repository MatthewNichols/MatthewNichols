## Hello, I am Matthew

### Stuff about me

- I am a (software/science/sci-fi/space/history) geek. 

- I am a Coloradan living in Iberia, mostly Gibraltar and Valencia. My Spanish is very limited but I am working on it.

- Veteran software developer, mostly on the web. I love Javascript/Typescript, 11ty, Vue, Babylon.JS, C#, VSCode and WSL. I am intrigued by Python, WASM and Rust but am still pretty new at them.

- I am an autodidact and usually learning lots of things; curiousity is probably my most defing trait. At the moment they include:
    - 3D Modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
    - Drawing with [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)
    - Photograpy
    - Cooking
    - Spanish

- I think the sorting hat would put me in Ravenclaw, but I think I have a slight Slytherin tendencies.
