## Hello, I am Matthew

### Stuff about me

- I am a (software/science/sci-fi/space/history) geek. 

- I am a slightly nomadic Coloradan living in mostly in Valencia, Spain. My Spanish is very limited but I am working on it.

- Veteran software developer, mostly on the web. I love Javascript/Typescript, NodeJS, 11ty, Vue, Babylon.JS, C#, VSCode and Linux. I was a Windows power user for a very long time, but switched over to desktop Linux a couple of years ago and love it. I am intrigued by Python, WASM and Rust but am still pretty new at them.

- I am an autodidact and usually learning lots of things; curiousity is probably my most defing trait. At the moment they include:
    - 3D Modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
    - Drawing with ~~[Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)~~ [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and SVG more broadly
    - Photograpy
    - Cooking
    - Spanish

- I think the sorting hat would put me in Ravenclaw, but I think I have slight Slytherin tendencies.
